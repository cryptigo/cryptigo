# Cryptigo
> Trying really hard since 2004.


Hello, my name is Connor, but most people call me Cryptigo or Cry.
I use this repository for mostly random files and backups, but once in a while, you might find something of use here.

I code mostly in C/C++, but from time to time i switch it up.

I also have a website. It's not finished yet, so it's mostly empty.
But if you still want to visit it for some reason, you can check it out [here](https://crydev.ca/).

cryptigo/cryptigo is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
